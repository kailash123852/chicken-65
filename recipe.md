Boneless chicken should be coated well with salt, egg, cornflour, and all-purpose flour. Add some water, if needed.
Fry the chicken in hot oil until crisp and golden brown.
Heat oil in a saucepan and add red chillies, garlic, and ginger grate and fry on a high flame.
After garlic is fried, add Schzewan sauce, aromatic powder, and the rest of the sauces and toss on a high flame.
When the sauces are getting fried, add water and boil until it reduced to half.
Add the chicken pieces to the sauce and toss on a high flame. While there is still some sauce left in the pan, add the grated spring onions and take it off the fire.
